Write the following object oriented program in C++:

Write a C++ program in which you define class employee and necessary functions for reading 
employees' information and saving them to an array of class employee. The member variables 
of the class should be: name, id, job, and salary. Define constructors with different set of 
parameters as well as the default constructor for the class. Define also search(), update() and 
to_string() methods for the class. 

The search() should receive a value for name or id or job or salary 
and returns a pointer to the object if the given search criteria matches the information of the current 
employee. 

The update() method should be used to update the id, name, job and salary of the employee. 

The to_string() method should return all object data as text. Declare all variables as private and use only methods 
for manipulating them. 

The program must print to the standard output a menu, from which user can choose the following actions:
A: add new employee information
R: remove employee's information
S: search based on employee's ID
Q: quit

The program must print to the standard output and update a counter which shows the number of employees whose information are saved in the database. 
The program must keep on showing the menu and letting the user to make a choice as long as Q is not pressed.
